## ofxCPS

Utility program to display Clicks per Second count \<ClicksPerSecond> and addon \<ofxCPS>.

```
App to display Clicks Per Second.

Your fingers are being strained while you play physically demanding mouse based games.

You have 5 fingers, and are moving only 2.

What about your other 5 fingers, from the other hand?

Try to click with 5 fingers, 1 at a time,

cyclically, any mouse button.

	Same button, or cross buttons.

		Change Hands.

Exercise both hands, normal clicks, butterfly clicks, jitter clicks,
drag clicks, tap clicks, etc. Awesome new techiques.

I would only advise you to use normal & butterfly clicks,
others are stressful towards your hands.

Report errors/issues with your stats.

Try to keep CPS count near 0.

```


#make

```
0. install openFrameworks, versions 0.7+ should be able to run this addon 
in any supported openFrameworks platform.

1. download openFrameworks, follow their install instructions, should work. 
(ask/search the forum if it doesn't?)

2. copy this addon and example app/code to OFROOT/addons/ofxCPS

3. use project generator to generate project files for your favourite IDE.

4. open the project, compile, program should be running. 
report issues if it's not.

5. click the window as fast as you can to check your CPS count.

6. I try to keep ClicksPerSecond count near 0. You can check your performance. 
It's very hard to go above 11 clicks per second, at least for me. 
I'd enjoy to see how many clicks you can make. 
Please send a screenshot or something if you want to see your performance.
There is an issues page under this repository, you can use it as you'd like.

7. if you feel frames per second of program too demanding on cpus, 
you can lower/increase it, visuals run on a different thread from keys, 
i guess any fps you decide should work?
